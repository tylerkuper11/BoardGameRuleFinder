	My Capstone project is going to be based off of the digital ludeme project which is a program that
takes the components and parameters of a board game and uses those things to predict the rules for said
board game. I would start out with a one-dimensional game to start out with and see if my program could 
predict the rules for it and then work my way up to more advanced games like maybe chess or checkers.
	A big challenge that would be in the way would be:
		-Creating the programs way of determining rules
		-Having the program work with two or three dimensional games
